# Projeto-quick-draw
Our project was designed to recognize some drawings made by a user on a website, send them to an Artificial Intelligence to recognize and return a response. We created a database with images of the following objects: apple, banana, knife, axe and cake. We used a TensorFlow to recognize the drawings in PNG format, stored locally in the 'downloads' folder of the computer.
As for programming languages, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used.

Step by step to run the project:

1- Download all files.

2- If it is not in a folder, put them in one named 'thing' and move the folder to 'documents' in the file manager.

3- After that, open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

4- Download the libraries for operation: 'flask', 'tensorflow' and 'opencv-python'.

5- Open the JS code and change the file path to your computer's path in the 'destination_folder' variable.

6- Run each of the three python files in different terminals with the function: 'python (filename).py.

7- Open another terminal and run the function: "python -m http.server".

8- The JS code will have two links specified for Windows or MacOS, just read and copy the one for the system you use.

9- Open a CMD and paste the link there, it will open chrome, do not log in with any user.

10- In the search tab, open the local host, for example ' http://localhost:8000/ '

Unable to upload machine learning file. Follow the instructions to create it:

1- Enter the Teachable machine and use images of the objects mentioned or those of your preference to create a model.

2- save the model and add it to the folder that is being used to store the programming files.
